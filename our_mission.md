Established in 2006, Blossom Academy is a dynamic educational daycare for children between the ages of 18 months to 5 years old. The daycare is located in the vibrant Notre-Dame-de-Grace neighbourhood of Montreal, QC in Canada (see our [Contact Us page]({{ site.baseurl}}/contact) to reach us). Registration and enrollment is based on availability which varies each academic year.

### Our Philosophy

We believe that the early years of learning are the most important and valuable in every childâ€™s life. Through play, daycare children learn. Play contributes to the development of academic ability. At Blossom Academy, we encourage each child to explore, experiment and develop skills at his or her own level of ability.

### Our Commitment

We are committed to offer a nice, warm and relaxed atmosphere, combining love, security, protection and physical care in our educational environment. This way the children can fulfill their needs and develop their potentials. We will teach your child to develop socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively.

### Our Program

Our educational program is offered for children between the ages of 18 months to 5 years old. At Blossom Academy, your children will have access to different activities, such as:

* Free Play
* Creative Play
* Art
* Music
* Science
* Finger Plays
* Story Time
* Math Concepts
* Pre-Reading/Writing
* Spanish
* French
* Gym and Physical Activities Outdoors

### Daily routine
As the children arrive in the morning, they have free play. Every day we start our structured program with musical movements, followed by circle time (in French). At this time they learn songs, finger plays and listen to the instructions of the next activity. This activity can either be math, pre-reading/writing, art, etc..

Snack is then served. Depending on the weather, some days we will go out to the park or we will have physical education inside the daycare. Before leaving or having lunch the children will listen to a story together.

The children learn to become independent and also to participate in group activities. They learn to take turns; help and care for the classroom materials. They learn to respect others as well as themselves.

In the afternoon, following rest/nap and snack time, we offer special activities like yoga, Spanish (dance), music, science & nature, etc..
