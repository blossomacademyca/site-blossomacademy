Established in 2006, Blossom Academy is a dynamic pre-school for children ages 12 months to 5 years old. The school is located in the vibrant Notre-Dame-de-Grace neighbourhood of Montreal, QC in Canada (see our Contact Us page to reach us). Registration and enrollment is based on availability which varies each academic year.

### Our Philosophy

We believe that the early years of learning are the most important and valuable in every child’s life. Through play, preschool children learn. Play contributes to the development of academic ability. At Blossom we encourage each child to explore, experiment and develop skills at his or her own level of ability.

### Our Commitment

We are committed to offer a nice, warm and relaxed atmosphere, combining love, security, protection and physical care in our educational environment, where the children can fulfill their needs and develop their potentials. We will teach your child to develop socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively

### Our Program

Our program is offered for children from one to five years old. Each program is based on the needs of preschool children. At Blossom Academy the children move throughout different rooms where they will find the activities that are included in our program. Our curriculum includes free play, music, creative play art, science, finger plays, story time, math concepts, pre-reading/writing, Spanish, French, and physical activities outdoors. As the children arrive in the morning, they have free play. Every day we start our structured program with musical movements, followed by circle time. At this time they learn songs, finger plays and listen to the instruction of the next activity. This activity can either be math, pre-reading/writing, Spanish or French class. Snack is then served, and they will prepare for art. Depending on the weather, some days we will go out to the park or we will have physical education inside the school. Before leaving or having lunch the children will listen to a story together. The children learn to become independent and also to participate in group activities. They learn to take turns; help and care for the classroom materials. They learn to respect others as well as themselves. Preschool education marks the beginning of learning to interact in a group, and for all children it is the beginning of school. Preschool education gives children a liking for school, promotes children’s development by motivating them to exploit their full potential, and arranges the social and cognitive basis that will prepare children for their future schooling and allow them to continue to learn throughout their lives.
