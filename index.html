Daycare education marks the beginning of learning to interact in a group, and for all children it is the beginning of daycare.
Daycare education gives children a liking for school, promotes childrenâ€™s development by motivating them to exploit their full potential. 
The social and cognitive basis developed in our daycare will prepare children for their future schooling and allow them to continue to learn throughout their lives.
