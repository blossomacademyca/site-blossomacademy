<p>Established in 2006, Blossom Academy is a dynamic educational daycare for children between the ages of 18 months to 5 years old.</p>

<p>The daycare is located in the vibrant Notre-Dame-de-Grace neighbourhood of Montreal, QC in Canada (see our <a href="https://blossomacademyca.github.io/site-blossomacademy/contact">Contact Us page</a> to reach us).</p>

<p>Registration and enrollment is based on availability which varies each academic year.</p>


<p>Daycare education marks the beginning of learning to interact in a group, and for all children it is the beginning of daycare.</p>
<p>Daycare education gives children a liking for school, promotes childrenâ€™s development by motivating them to exploit their full potential. </p>
<p>The social and cognitive basis developed in our daycare will prepare children for their future schooling and allow them to continue to learn throughout their lives.</p>
