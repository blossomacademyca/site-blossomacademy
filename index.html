Established in 2006, Blossom Academy is a dynamic pre-school for children ages 12 months to 5 years old.

The school is located in the vibrant Notre-Dame-de-Grace neighbourhood of Montreal, QC in Canada (see our [Contact Us page]({{ site.baseurl}}/contact) to reach us).

Registration and enrollment is based on availability which varies each academic year. 


Daycare education marks the beginning of learning to interact in a group, and for all children it is the beginning of daycare.
Daycare education gives children a liking for school, promotes childrenâ€™s development by motivating them to exploit their full potential. 
The social and cognitive basis developed in our daycare will prepare children for their future schooling and allow them to continue to learn throughout their lives.
